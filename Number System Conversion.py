# Number System Conversion
# count starts from 0 to the 2nd last no. eg: base = 2 so
# 0,1 and not counting 2
# Decimel = base 10
# Binary  = base 2
# Octa = base 8
# Hexa = base 16

decimel = 10
binary  = 2
octa = 8
hexa = 16

# print(dec(decimel))
print(bin(binary))
print(oct(octa))
print(hex(hexa))
